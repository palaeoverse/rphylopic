# Scales for phylopic height or width

`scale_height_continuous()` scales the height of silhouettes whereas
`scale_width_continuous()` scales the height of silhouettes.

## Usage

``` r
scale_height_continuous(
  name = waiver(),
  breaks = waiver(),
  labels = waiver(),
  limits = NULL,
  range = c(1, 6),
  transform = "identity",
  trans = lifecycle::deprecated(),
  guide = "none"
)

scale_width_continuous(
  name = waiver(),
  breaks = waiver(),
  labels = waiver(),
  limits = NULL,
  range = c(1, 6),
  transform = "identity",
  trans = lifecycle::deprecated(),
  guide = "none"
)
```

## Arguments

- name:

  The name of the scale. Used as the axis or legend title. If
  [`waiver()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/waiver.html), the
  default, the name of the scale is taken from the first mapping used
  for that aesthetic. If `NULL`, the legend title will be omitted.

- breaks:

  One of:

  - `NULL` for no breaks

  - [`waiver()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/waiver.html)
    for the default breaks computed by the [transformation
    object](https://scales.r-lib.org/reference/new_transform.html)

  - A numeric vector of positions

  - A function that takes the limits as input and returns breaks as
    output (e.g., a function returned by
    [`scales::extended_breaks()`](https://scales.r-lib.org/reference/breaks_extended.html)).
    Note that for position scales, limits are provided after scale
    expansion. Also accepts rlang
    [lambda](https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/as_function.html)
    function notation.

- labels:

  One of:

  - `NULL` for no labels

  - [`waiver()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/waiver.html)
    for the default labels computed by the transformation object

  - A character vector giving labels (must be same length as `breaks`)

  - An expression vector (must be the same length as breaks). See
    ?plotmath for details.

  - A function that takes the breaks as input and returns labels as
    output. Also accepts rlang
    [lambda](https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/as_function.html)
    function notation.

- limits:

  One of:

  - `NULL` to use the default scale range

  - A numeric vector of length two providing limits of the scale. Use
    `NA` to refer to the existing minimum or maximum

  - A function that accepts the existing (automatic) limits and returns
    new limits. Also accepts rlang
    [lambda](https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/as_function.html)
    function notation. Note that setting limits on positional scales
    will **remove** data outside of the limits. If the purpose is to
    zoom, use the limit argument in the coordinate system (see
    [`coord_cartesian()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/coord_cartesian.html)).

- range:

  a numeric vector of length 2 that specifies the minimum and maximum
  size of the plotting symbol after transformation.

- transform:

  For continuous scales, the name of a transformation object or the
  object itself. Built-in transformations include "asn", "atanh",
  "boxcox", "date", "exp", "hms", "identity", "log", "log10", "log1p",
  "log2", "logit", "modulus", "probability", "probit", "pseudo_log",
  "reciprocal", "reverse", "sqrt" and "time".

  A transformation object bundles together a transform, its inverse, and
  methods for generating breaks and labels. Transformation objects are
  defined in the scales package, and are called `transform_<name>`. If
  transformations require arguments, you can call them from the scales
  package, e.g.
  [`scales::transform_boxcox(p = 2)`](https://scales.r-lib.org/reference/transform_boxcox.html).
  You can create your own transformation with
  [`scales::new_transform()`](https://scales.r-lib.org/reference/new_transform.html).

- trans:

  **\[deprecated\]** Deprecated in favour of `transform`.

- guide:

  A function used to create a guide or its name. See
  [`guides()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/guides.html) for
  more information.
