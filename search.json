See ?plotmath details. function takes breaks input returns labels output. Also accepts rlang lambda function notation. limits One : NULL use default scale range numeric vector length two providing limits scale. Use NA refer existing minimum maximum function accepts existing (automatic) limits returns new limits. Also accepts rlang lambda function notation. Note setting limits positional scales remove data outside limits. purpose zoom, use limit argument coordinate system (see coord_cartesian()). range numeric vector length 2 specifies minimum maximum size plotting symbol transformation. transform continuous scales, name transformation object object . Built-transformations include \"asn\", \"atanh\", \"boxcox\", \"date\", \"exp\", \"hms\", \"identity\", \"log\", \"log10\", \"log1p\", \"log2\", \"logit\", \"modulus\", \"probability\", \"probit\", \"pseudo_log\", \"reciprocal\", \"reverse\", \"sqrt\" \"time\". transformation object bundles together transform, inverse, methods generating breaks labels. Transformation objects defined scales package, called transform_<name>. transformations require arguments, can call scales package, e.g. scales::transform_boxcox(p = 2). can create transformation scales::new_transform(). trans Deprecated favour transform. guide function used create guide name.
